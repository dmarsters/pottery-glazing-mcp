# MORPHISMS: How types relate and transform
morphisms:
  Colorant_to_VisualEffect:
    domain: ColorDevelopment
    codomain: GlazeEffect
    mechanism: "oxide chemistry + firing atmosphere → hue + saturation + value"
    example: "IronReds (morphism via reduction atmosphere) → ShinyGloss with deep color saturation"

  FluxBehavior_to_SurfaceTexture:
    domain: FluxBehavior
    codomain: SurfaceTexture
    mechanism: "flux viscosity + melt rate → surface matte/gloss spectrum"
    example: "BoronFlux (high fluidity) → GlossyClear; AlkalineFlux (moderate) → SilkMatte"

  Atmosphere_to_ColorModulation:
    domain: FiringAtmosphere
    codomain: ColorDevelopment
    mechanism: "oxygen availability → oxidation states of colorants"
    example: "Reduction (morphism) takes CopperGreens toward CopperReds with darkening"

  Temperature_to_GlazeMaturation:
    domain: TemperatureRange
    codomain: GlazeEffect
    mechanism: "heat energy → flux activity + crystalline structure formation"
    example: "HighFire (morphism) intensifies gloss, develops crystalline structure"

  CompositeEffect:
    domain: "ColorDevelopment × FluxBehavior × FiringAtmosphere × TemperatureRange"
    codomain: GlazeEffect
    mechanism: "synergistic interaction of all chemistry dimensions"
    constraint: "not all combinations produce visually distinctive effects—only certain morphism paths create signature looks"

# COMMUTATIVE DIAGRAMS: Verification paths for consistent transformations
commutative_diagrams:
  Reduction_Copper_Red:
    description: "Copper oxide under reduction produces characteristic deep red"
    path_1: "CopperGreens → (Reduction) → DeepRed → (SilkMatte) → ReducedCopperRed"
    path_2: "Reduction → (OxidationStateShift) → DeepRed; SilkMatteFlux → (Interaction) → ReducedCopperRed"
    commutativity: "Both paths yield same visual: deep red, matte, possibly runny"

  Boron_Gloss_Development:
    description: "Boron flux creates characteristic glossy surface"
    path_1: "BoronFlux → (HighFluidityMorphism) → GlossyClear → (ColorantInteraction) → ColoredGloss"
    path_2: "Colorant → (BoronFluxInteraction) → EnhancedHue; HighFluidityMorphism → (GlossDevelopment) → ColoredGloss"
    commutativity: "Boron first or colorant first produces same gloss + hue outcome"

# SENSORY INTENTION PRINCIPLES (Category Theory grounding)
# Why these morphisms work for image generation
sensory_intention:
  depth_of_color:
    principle: "Saturation inversely correlates with gloss in reduction; oxidation → lighter, more saturated hues"
    visual_implication: "reduction glazes feel heavy/dark; oxidation glazes feel bright/clear"
    image_param: "color saturation, value darkness"

  surface_polish:
    principle: "Flux viscosity determines whether glaze surface becomes mirror-smooth (boron) or matte (alkaline earth)"
    visual_implication: "boron glazes = reflective, luminous; alkaline earth = absorptive, grounded"
    image_param: "specular highlights, diffuse reflection, perceived texture"

  edge_behavior:
    principle: "Running glazes (high fluidity) pool at rims and drip at edges; matte glazes stay put"
    visual_implication: "glossy + running = dynamic, fluid feeling; matte + static = stable, earthy"
    image_param: "gradient direction, edge definition, sense of flow"

  interaction_intensity:
    principle: "Colorant saturation increases under reduction; decreases under oxidation"
    visual_implication: "reduction = intense, deep, mysterious; oxidation = clear, bright, direct"
    image_param: "color intensity, contrast ratio, perceived depth"
